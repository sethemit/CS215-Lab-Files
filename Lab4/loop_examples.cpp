/*
 * Course: CS215-00x
 * Project: Demo Loops
 * Purpose: this program contains two sub-problems:
 *			1. start with a simple example: to print one row of n stars (n is the user input positive integer)
 *			   requirement: for this sub-problem, you need to practice three Loop statements: while; for; do-while
 *                          
 *			2. then prints FOUR Triangle patterns decribed in lecture slides
 *             purpose: to practice nested loop structure
