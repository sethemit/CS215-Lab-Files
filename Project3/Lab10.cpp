/*
 * Course: CS215-012
 * Project: Lab 10 (as first part of Project 3)
 * Purpose: Demonstrate how to use Card class and Deck class
 *          First, it creates 52 cards on deck
 *          Second, it deals 26 cards for each of two players
 *          Then it displays cards in player1's hand and in player2's hand respectively
 *          Test running the program under two different cases:
 *          Case 1: comment out // playDeck.shuffleDeck(); at line number 28
 *          Case 2: activate statement at line number 28
