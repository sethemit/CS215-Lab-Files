 *Course: CS215 - 012
 *Project: Lab 8 (As part of Project 2)
 *Purpose: It demonstrates the game of Nim played between two computer players
 *         In combinatorial game theory, a two-player deterministic perfect information turn-based game
 *         is a first-player-win if with perfect play the first player to move can always force a win.
 *         This program also shows that the game of Nim is a "CONDITIONAL first-player-win" game using two computer players.
